Running pdflatex on my (Paul's) machine (running OSX) gives a document
with letter as opposed to a4 paper size. Run these commands to
generate an a4 version:

latex paper.tex
dvips -t a4 paper.dvi
ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 paper.ps


Check that it's an a4 with:

pdfinfo paper.pdf

Check that fonts are embedded with:

pdffonts paper.pdf
