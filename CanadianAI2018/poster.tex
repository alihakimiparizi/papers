\begin{itemize}

\item Conclusions
\begin{itemize}
\item SVM+wordvec outperformed other models tested in terms of accuracy and average F1
\item We showed that the word2vec representation can better capture the writing style of an author used for verification using two different types of classifiers

\end{itemize}

\item Future work
\begin{itemize}
\item Find other document represenations to improve performance such as doc2vec
