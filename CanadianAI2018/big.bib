	into multiple component words, but have properties that are
	unpredictable with respect to their component words. In this paper we
	propose the first deep learning models for token-level identification
	of MWEs. Specifically, we consider a layered feedforward network, a
	recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural networks. In
	experimental results we show that convolutional neural networks are
	able to outperform the previous state-of-the-art for MWE
	identification, with a convolutional neural network with three hidden
